'''
Visig - visualize and animate signals using mpl
'''
# TODO:
# - consider using sox conversion in this module so we can open
#   arbitrarly formatted audio files as numpy arrays (pysox?)
# - 'Signal' class which is delegated all data unpacking and metadata maintenance
# - animation for simple playback using a cursor on the chosen axes (add mixing?)
# - animation for rt spectrum
# - mechanism to animate arbitrary computations in rt
# - capture sreen dimensions using pure python
# - create a callback mechnism which interfaces like a rt algo block and
#   allows for metric animations used for algo development
